Hi, I am Alex and this is my online home. 

I use this mainly as a mode of semi-professional presentation, so if you search for me on the web, you find something useful. 
Occasionally, in form of a blog-post or two I will use this as a space to summarize lessons that I learn here and there.

I have a background in *Business*, *Neuroeconomics*, *Statistics* and *Cognitive Science*. A somewhat eclective, somewhat useful mix 
of degrees that left me with an interdisciplinary perspective (read: I can, but also cannot relate to many folks) and a collection of skills to 
do some constructive damage. If you have time on your hands and you are interested in what I have been up to for the last stint of education, feel free to read my 
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data/af_phd_thesis_library_final_compressed.pdf"> PhD thesis </a>.

Currently, I am a post doctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/carney/">Carney Institute for Brain Science </a>, situated on the 
campus of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University </a> in Providence, Rhode Island. 
Here I continue the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65074"> main line of research </a> on simulation based inference for cognitive process models. 

Conjointly I work as a Principal Data Scientist for <a href="https://www.pymc-labs.io/"> PyMC Labs </a>, 
where I help clients with Bayesian Statistical Analysis. PyMC Labs is a Bayesian Consultancy with deep expertise in Statistical Methodology, 
supercharged by the power of the <a href="https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html">PyMC</a> Python toolbox for Bayesian Inference. You can find a public presentation of this work <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data/webinar_pymc.pdf"> here </a> (slides) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD03v_eOo88"> here </a> (video).

If you want to know more about me (and you are a benign actor), you can check my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data/af_docs_cv_webpage.pdf">CV</a>, the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data/af_docs_cv_one_page.pdf">one page resume</a>, or click on any of the handles at the bottom of this page.
